## Taxonomy
Taxonomy is a system for categorising living organisms (cellular organisms) into related groups. <br>
The taxonomy hierarchy has the following classifications: <br>

  - __Domain__ (e.g. Eukarya)
  - __Kingdom__ (e.g. Animalia)
  - __Phylum__ (e.g. Chordata, Animals with spinal columns)
  - __Class__ (e.g. Mammalia)
  - __Order__ (e.g. Carnivora)
  - __Family__ (e.g. Canidae)
  - __Genus__ (e.g. Vulpes)
  - __Species__ (e.g. vulpes)

### Phylogenetic Trees
A phylogenetic tree is a way of show how different organisms are related to each other from an evolutionary (genetic) standpoint using the taxonomy classifications. <br>
When referring to a living organism we describe it be it's Genus and Species (e.g. _Homo sapiens_). <br>
This method of referring to oranisms is called __binomial nomenclature__. <br>
At the top level a Phylogenetic Tree splits into 3 domains (Archaea, Bacteria and Eukaryotes). <br>
Note that within one species of organism there can be several __strains__. 
From a genetic standpoint different strains are almost identical however they can still have very different attributes.
For example there are many different strains of _Escheriichia coli_ (E. coli) but only a few of them cause disease.
Generally organisims are classified based on RNA, DNA and their proteins.

### Archaea

Like bacteria, Archaea are unicellular prokaryotic organisms. <br>
Archaea have significantly different genetics (specifically the subunit ribosomal rRNA), metabolic pathways and cellular walls compared to Bacteria. <br>
Archaea don't have peptodoglycan in their cellular walls. <br>
No Archaea has been found to act as a pathogen. <br>
Both Bacteria and Archaea have been found in extremely hostile environments including very hot, cold, basic and acidic. <br>
The size of bacteria and archaea is generally in the range of 1 to 10 micrometers. <br>

### Bacteria

Bacteria are prokaryotic organisms meaning their cells do not contain a nucleus. <br>
For the fast majority of Bacteria the cell walls contain a substance called peptodoglycan. <br>
While not a defining feature many bacteria are unicellular. <br>
Most Bacteia are harmless while some are beneficial, some also act as disease carrying pathogens. <br>
Bacteria lack distingishing physical features with which to tell them apart such as arms and feathers. 
As a result many bacteria apear physicall identical. 
Bacteria are identified/classified through biochemical tests such as DNA/RNA analysis 
and staining culivated samples with different idetifiers can show what chemicals are contained in a bacteria.
Serological tests can be used to identify antibodies that react with the proteins found in certain species of bacteria. <br>
To this end __Bergey's Manuals__ of determinative and systemic bacteriology provide a standard reference for classifying bacteria. <br>
Additionally bacteria are often described by their general shape which are usually spherical, cylindrical or sprial.

### Eukaryotes

Eukaryotes are organisms with eukaryotic cells (containing a nuclues). <br>
Eukaryotes are generally large multicellular organisms. <br>

#### Algae

__Protists__ are a grouping of eukaryotes that are not plans, animals or fungi, examples pf this are algae and protozoas. <br>
Algea can be unicellular or multicellular. <br>
The cell walls of Algea are made of cellulose. <br>
Photosynthetic organisms that extract energy from the sun and release Oxygen.

#### Protozoa

Diverse groups of organisms. <br>
Move using hair like structures called __cilia__ and __flagella__. <br>
Most protozoa are harmless but some can acts as pathogens. <br>

#### Fungi

Can be large multicellular organisms such as mushrooms. <br>
There are unicellular fungi called __yeasts__ and __molds__. <br>
There are beneficial yeats which cause fermentation and make bread rise <br>
There are beneficial molds which help in the decomposition of dead animals and create medicine such as penicillin. <br>
There are pathogenic yeasts which cause diseases such as vaginal yeast infection and oral thrush. <br>
There are pathogenic molds which produce disease causing metabolites called mycotoxins. <br>

#### Helminths

Large multicellular parasitic worms that lay microscopic eggs. <br>
Infection from a helminh usually occurs after drinking infected water. <br>

### Viruses

__Acellular organisms__ (Their body is not composed of cells). <br>
Consists entirely of proteins and either DNA or RNA (never both). There are no Lipids or Carbohydrates. <br>
Viruses are inert outside a host cell. They rely on infecting cellular organimisms and using their cellular mechanisms to reproduce.
Viruses can generally only occupy very specific cells so most are harmless to humans. <br>
Viruses are generally 50 to 100 nanometers in size.


### Pirons

Ten times smaller than viruses. <br>
Composed entirely of proteins, hey can cause damage to cellular organisms by changing their shape. <br>
Responsible for several chronic, fatal degenerative brain diseases such as mad cow disease. <br>
