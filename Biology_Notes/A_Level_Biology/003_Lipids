MOLECULAR COMPOSITION OF A HUMAN

    80% water
    20% dry weight

        - Protein: 50%
        - Carbohydrates: 15%
        - Lipids and Fats: 10%
        - Nucleic Acids (DNA/RNA): 15%
        - Minerals and Salts: 10%

LIPIDS

    Fatty Acids:              Long chains of hydrocarbons with a carboxyl (COOH) group at the end
    Saturated fatty acid:     The hydrocarbon chain has no double bonds between carbons, Therefore there is the maximum amount of hydrogen (fat)
    Unsaturated fatty acid:   There is at least one carbon double bond. This causes the molecule to bend reducing intermolecular forces (oil)

    TRIGLYCERIDES
        Combination of three fatty acids with a glycerol (C3H8O3, 3 hydroxyl groups) molecule
        The carboxyl group of each of the fatty acids forms a condensation reaction with one of the hydroxyl groups
        Triglycerides are very hydrophobic molecules

    PHOSPOLIPIDS
        One of the fatty acids is replaced with a phosphate group
        The phosphate group is negatively charged making it hydrophilic
        Phospolipids have both a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail

        When placed in water phospolipids form two possible configurations
        One of these configurations is a cell membrane made of two layers of phospolipids

        MICELLES: When phospolipids in water from a single layer with the heads facing out (towards water) and the tails facing in
