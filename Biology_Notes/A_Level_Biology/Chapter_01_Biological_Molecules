Prior Information:
    1. Glucose produced by plants during photosynthesis may be inverted into insoluble starch
    2. During aerobic respiration chemical reactions occur that use glucose and oxygen to release energy
    3. Glucose in plants is used to produce fat for storage, and cellulose which strengthens the cells walls
    4. Protein molecules are made of long strings of amino acids
    5. Proteins act as structural components for muscles, antibodies, hormones and catalysts
    6. catalysts increase the rate of chemical reactions, In biology proteins called enzymes are used as catalysts
    7. The shape of an enzyme affect it's function and high temperatures affect the shape of an enzyme
    8. Different enzymes work best at different pH levels and some enzymes can work outside the body's cells

    ENERGY
        Mammals and birds require energy to maintain a constant body temperature
        Energy is also required for the following biological processes:
            Growth
            Cell division
            Muscle Contraction
            Protein Synthesis
            Active Transport
            Nerve Impulses


    ATP (ADENOSINE TRIPHOSPHATE)
        This molecule is a nucleotide responsible for intracellular energy transfers
        It is able to store and transport chemical energy within cells
        Also plays a role in the synthesis of nucleic acids
            - ATP molecules are able to store energy like a rechargeable battery

        ATP is stored in the muscle fibres and used up during muscle contractions ???


    GLYCOLYSIS
        Metabolic process which serve as the foundation of aerobic and anaerobic cellular respiration
        Glycolysis converts glucose into pyruvate
        Glucose molecules are found in the blood and are a result of the breakdown of carbohydrates into sugars


    AEROBIC RESPIRATION
        Chemical reaction that transfers energy to cells
        Reactants are glucose and oxygen
        Waste products are carbon dioxide and water

        Cells need energy in order to reproduce, this energy is obtained from glucose.
        Animals obtain their glucose by eating plants and other animals.
        Plants need to make their own glucose through photosynthesis.

        Plants and animals both transport glucose and oxygen to tiny structures in their cells called mitochondria
          - mitochondria are found in the cell cytoplasm
        The glucose and oxygen take part in a chemical reaction (aerobic respiration)
        This reaction releases energy (exothermic) which is absorbed by the cells

        The reaction creates two waste products, carbon dioxide and water
        Animals remove the carbon dioxide from their bodies when they breath out
        Plants release CO2 from the leaves at night, during the day the CO2 is used in photosynthesis to produce more glucose

        Chemical equation for Aerobic Respiration
            C6-H12-O6(s) + 6O2(g) -> 6CO2(g) + 6H2O(g) + energy


    ANAEROBIC RESPIRATION
        Chemical reaction that releases energy from glucose
        The amount of energy released is much smaller (5%) since the glucose is not fully broken down
        Occurs during intense exercise since there is not enough oxygen for the amount of energy required
        The chemical reaction takes place in the cells cytoplasm rather than the mitochondria

        In this case oxygen is not used, the only reactant is glucose
        The resulting waste product in animals lactic acid
        The resulting waste product in plants is carbon dioxide and ethanol

        At some point the lactic acid needs to be oxidised to break it down into carbon dioxide and water.
        This need for oxygen is why we continue to breath heavily at when we stop exercising

        Chemical equation for Anaerobic Respiration in Animals
            C6-H12-O6(s) -> 2C3-H6-O3(s) + energy

        Chemical equation for Anaerobic Respiration in Plants
            C6-H12-O6(s) -> 2C2-H5-OH(s) + 2CO2 + energy


    PHOTOSYNTHESIS
        Photosynthesis is the process through which plants create glucose from energy taken in through sun-light
        Plants use carbon dioxide taken in from the air through their leaves and water taken from the ground through their roots
          - Plants also produce carbon dioxide and water as waste product of aerobic respiration. These can be used during photosynthesis
        With the addition of energy a chemical reaction occurs which converts the carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen
        This can then be transported to the mitochondria in the cells to be used in an aerobic reaction to transfer energy into the cells

        During the day plants take in carbon dioxide which they use in photosynthesis. Plants also produce carbon dioxide through respiration
        However the amount of carbon dioxide taken in is greater than that produced, thus during the day plants are a net user of CO2.
        At night photosynthesis stops however respiration continues to produce CO2. At this point the plant is a net contributor to CO2.
        Generally over it's lifetime a plant will take in more CO2 than it produces, but this depends on the plant and it's environment.

        Since most of the plants in the world are in the northern hemisphere, more CO2 is absorbed when it's summer in the north as their is more sunlight.
        In this sense CO2 levels in the planet increase when it's winter in the north and decrease when it's summer.

        Chemical Equation of glucose:
            C6-H12-O6

        Chemical Equation of photosynthesis:
            6CO2 + 6H2O + Energy -> C6-H12-O6 + 6O2

    FERMENTATION
        The process by which alcohol is created
        Leaving a glass of sugar water (fruit juice) will result in cloudy bubbly substance (alcohol)
        The bubbles are carbon dioxide and the cloudy substance is yeast
        Yeast is the cause of the Fermentation
        Yeast is a living organism which multiples using the sugar in the water and produces the carbon dioxide

Summary:
  Carbohydrates:    Respiratory substrate through which cells release energy to carry out their function
  Lipids:           Major component of plasma membranes in the cell
  Proteins:         Act as enzymes to perform functions
  Nucleic Acids:    Carry information detailing the structure of proteins
  Water:            Not a carbon-based molecule but is the most common component of cells


BONDING

    COVALENT BONDING
        Atoms share an electron in their outer shell

        POLAR COVALENT BOND
            Covalent bond where the electrons forming the bond are unequally distributed
            This causes a small electrical charge (dipole) at one side of the molecule
            Hydrogen atoms generally form polar covalent bonds
            These dipoles are the basis for hydrogen bonds

        NON-POLAR COVALENT BONDING
            Form when the difference in electro-negativity between two atoms is very low
            These generally only


    IONIC BONDING
        Ions with opposite charges attract each other to form Ionic Bonds
        Ionic bonds are weaker than covalent bonds
        Example Na+ cation and Cl- anion form an ionic bond to make sodium chloride (NaCl)
        Ionic bonds occur when the electro-negativity between two atoms is very large (ie between a metal and a non-metal)

    HYDROGEN BONDING
        The electrons in the molecule are not evenly distributed causing a small negative charge in one region
        These molecules are said to be polarised (polar molecule)
        The negative region of one molecule and the positive region of another molecule form a weak electrostatic bond
        The most famous example is the hydrogen bonds between water molecules

    ISOTOPES
        Atoms of the same element (same number of protons) that have different numbers of neutrons


POLYMERISATION
    The process by which monomers join together to from polymers

    MONOMERS:
        Molecules that can be linked together to form long chains
        Most monomers are made of carbon
            - Monosaccharides
            - Amino acids
            - Nucleotides

    POLYMERS:
        These are the long chains of monomers
        polythene:           man made polymer
        polynucleotides:     naturally occurring polymer, composed of 13 or more nucleotide monomers covalently bonded in a chain (DNA and RNA)
        Polypeptides:        naturally occurring polymer, covalently bonded amino acids, these polymers join together to make proteins
        polysaccharide:      naturally occurring polymer, the monomer is usually a single sugar such as glucose (Forms starch/carbohydrates)

    CONDENSATION:
        The formation of polymers though polymerisation releases one water (H2O) molecule at each bond between monomers
        reactions that produce water this way are called condensation reactions

    HYDROLYSIS:
        Polymers can be broken down by adding water (hydrolysis)
        Polypeptides broken down to amino acids and starch broken down to glucose
        When a bond between monomers is broken the components of the water molecule is split between the two monomers that formed the bond
        Carbohydrates obtained through eating are broken down into glucose which can be used in aerobic and anaerobic respiration

    METABOLISM
        All chemical reactions that take place inside a living organism


THE MOLE
    One mole is the number of atoms in 12 grams of carbon-12
    One mole of atoms is 6.022 x 10^23 atoms, also known as Avogadro's number

    MOLAR SOLUTION
        One mole of solute dissolved in a solvent (i.e. water)

    If a molecule has a molecular mass of 58.5 then one mole of that molecule will weight 58.5 g


CARBOHYDRATES AND MONOSACCHARIDES
    Carbo -> carbon and Hydrate -> water

    Carbon atoms readily bond with other carbon atoms.
    This allows them to form chains which act as the backbone along which other atoms can attach
        - This allows the allows the formation of many molecules with different shapes and properties
        - In living organisms not many other atoms bond to hydrogen so life is therefore based on a small number of elements
        - These are carbon, oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen

    Carbohydrates are polysaccharide polymers. they are made from sugars (ie glucose) known as saccharides
        - one saccharide:   monosaccharide
        - two saccharide:   disaccharide (i.e maltose, surcose)
        - many saccharide:  ploysaccharide

    MONOSACCHARIDES:
        Sweet tasting sugars with the formaul (CH2O)n where n is any number from 3 to 7
        Examples: glucose (C6-H12-O6), fructose (C6-H12-O6)

    ISOMERS
        There are different possible arrangements of the atoms in a glucose molecule
        These different arrangements are called isomers
        glucose has two isomers (alpha-glucose and beta-glucose)

    DISACCHARIDES
        Glucose-Glucose     -> Maltose (reducing sugar)
        Glucose-Fructose    -> Surcose (non-reducing sugar)
        Glucose-Galactose   -> Lactose

        When two monosaccharides join to form a disaccharide a molecule of water is removed (condensation reaction)
        The resulting bond is called a glycosidic bond

        When Water is added to a disaccharide it breaks down the glycosidc bond releasing the two monosaccharides (hydrolysis)

    POLYSACCHARIDES
        When many monosaccharides join together in a chain through condensation reactions
        Polysaccharides are insoluable and therefore suitable for storage
        Cellulose is not used for storage but instead gives structure to the cells

        Cellulose:
        Starch:       200 -> 100,000 monosaccharides joined together

        BENEDICTS TEST FOR REDUCING SUGARS
            A reducing sugar is one that can donate electrons to another compounds (free aldehyde functional group)
            Reducing sugars are also known as simple carbohydrates
            All monosaccharides and some disaccharides are reducing sugars

            Benedict's reagent changes colour depending on the amount of reducing sugar present in the solution
                - Blue:     No Reducing Sugar
                - Green:    Trace Reducing Sugars
                - Orange:   Moderate Reducing Sugars
                - Red:      High Reducing Sugars

            BENEDICT'S REAGENT
                Benedict's solution contains Cu+2 ions. When combined with a reducing sugar and heated the electrons donated by the
                reducing sugar causes the Cu+2 ions to change to Cu+1 ions, These Cu+1 ions bond with oxygen in the air to form
                copper oxide (which has the red colour similar to rust)

                One litre of Benedict’s solution can be prepared from 100 g of anhydrous sodium carbonate, 173 g of sodium citrate and 17.3 g of copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate.
                The sodium carbonate stops the Cu+2 ions from naturally reducing to Cu+1 ions

            Complex carbohydrates (such as starch) do not react readily with the Benedict's reagent.
            They first need to be broken down through heat or digestion into simple sugars

            PROCEDURE
                Mix a solution of the sugar to be tested with an equal volume solution of Benedict's reagent
                Heat in boiling water for 5 minutes
                A colour change to read indicates 1.5% - 2.0% of the test solution is sugar

    TEST FOR NON_REDUCING SUGARS
        Grind up the food sample and test 2cm^3 of the food sample with 2cm^3 of Benedict's reagent
        If the solution remains blue then there are no reducing sugars present in the food
        Mix the food sample with 2cm^3 of hydrochloric acid and heat it.
            - This will cause hydrolysis to take place and the disaccharide will be broken down into the two monosaccharides
            - Add sodium hydrogencarbonate solution to neutralise the hydrochloric acid (Use pH paper to check the solution is alkaline)



    NUTRITION
        It's better to consume more complex carbohydrates such as starch and fibre

        There are there types of carbohydrates
            - fibre (complex carbohydrate)
            - starch (complex carbohydrate)
            - sugar (simple carbohydrate)

        SIMPLE CARBOHYDRATES (SUGARS)
            Simple carbohydrates are broken down quickly and are used by the body to make energy (aerobic respiration)
            Glucose and fructose
            Found in milk, raw sugar and fruit

        COMPLEX CARBOHYDRATES (FIBRE AND STARCH)
            Complex carbohydrates digest more slowly (slower energy release) and make you feel more full
            Fibre is found in Nuts, beans vegetables and whole grains
            Starch is found in Cereal, wheat, oats and rice


    STARCH
        Starch is never found in animal cells (Only in plants). In animals Glycogen performs the same function
        Starch is a polysaccharide found in many plants in the form of small grains (i.e. starch grains in chlorophlasts).
            - Chlorophlasts are organelles found in plant cells which absord energy from sun-light

        The main purpose of starch is energy storage
            - Stach is compact so a lot can be stored in a small space
            - When hydrolysed it breaks down to alpha-glucose which is easily transported and used in cellular respiration
            - A starch polysacchraide can form many branches, each branch can simultaneously be broken down by an enzyme allowing quick relases of alpha-glucose
            - Since starch is large and insoluable it doesn't diffuse out of cells and water isn't drawn into cells through osmosis

        The chain of alpha-glucose molecules that makes up starch is wound in a tight coil (Helix) making starch compact
        The OH atoms in each glucose molecule (monosaccharide) are pointed towards the center of the starch coil (helix)
            - These OH atoms form the hydrogen bonds which keep the helix together

        TEST FOR STARCH
            Starch chenges the colour of iodine from yellow to blue/black
            The test is carried out at room temperature
            Create a 2cm^3 solution of the test substance, add 2 drops of potassium iodide and observe any colour changes


    GLYCOGEN
        Glycogen is never found in plant cells, only in animal cells
        Glycogen is the major carbohydrate storage product of animals.
        It is very similar to starch except it forms shorter more highly branched chains

        Glycogen is stored as small granules mostly in the liver and muscles
        In animals fat is the main method of energy storage so the mass of carbohydrates (Glycogen) is comparatively small

        The higher number of branches allow glycogen to be broken down more quickly
            - This is important to animals who have a higher metobolic rate due to them being more active

    CELLULOSE
        Cellulose is made from beta-glucose rather the alpha-glucose
        This makes if form straight non-branching chains (unlike starch and glycogen)
        Chains of cellulose run parallel to eachother allowing hydrogen bonds to form between chains of cellulose
        In Cellulose the OH groups which create the hydrogen bonds occur on both sides of the polymer chain
            - Every other beta glucose molecule is rotated by 180 degrees

        The number of hydrogen bonds between two parallel cellulose chains creates a large attractive force
        This makes the cellulose chains ideal for use as a structural material in the cell

        Cellulose chains combine together to form microfibrils which in turn combine to form fibres
        Cellulose is the main component of plant cell walls
        It keeps leaves and stems (non-wooden parts) semi-rigid so they will have maximum surface area for photosythesis
        The cellulose wall also prevents the cell from bursting when water enters it

    SUMMARY
        Starch    -> Formed from alpha-glucose
        Glycogen  -> Formed from alpha-glucose
        Cellulose -> Formed from beta-glucose

    LIPIDS
        Lipids are hydrocarbon molecules that the body uses to store energy, as insulation and to make cell membranes
        The main groups of lipids are triglycerides (fats and oils) and phospholipids (cell membranes)
        Fats are the most common lipids but others include:
            Fats and Oils (tri-glycerides)
            Fatty Acids
            Certain Vitamins (A, D, E and K)
            The Cell membrane that isn't made of protein
            Some hormones
                - Hormones are divided into 3 classes (lipid-derived, aminio-acid derived and peptide hormones)

        ROLES OF LIPIDS
            Energy store  - When oxidized lipids (fats) provide more than twice the energy of carbohydrates
            Waterproofing - Lipids are insoluble in water, mammals produce an oily secretion from their skin to act as waterproofing
            Insulation    - Fats are good insulators for heat and electricity and can be used to keep the body warm
            Protection    - Fat is stored around delicate organs (kidneys) for protection

        PROPERTIES OF LIPIDS
            1. They contain oxygen, hydrogen and carbon
            2. They are non-soluable in water
            3. They are soluable in alcohols and acetone (organic solvents)

        TRIGLYCERIDES
            Most common type of lipid
            Name comes from the fact that three fatty acids are bonded with a glycerol molecule
            Each of the fatty acid's carboxyl group (COOH) bonds with one of the CH2OH groups of glycerol in a condensation reaction
                - Since there are three bonds three water molecules are released during the reaction
                - The reverse hydrolysis reaction produces a glycerol molecule and the three fatty acids
            The 3 fatty acids may be the same (simple triglyceride) or different (mixed triglyceride)

            There are 70 different fatty acids
            They all consist of a COOH group with a chain of hydrocarbons attached
                SATURATED fatty acids have no carbon-carbon double bonds (i.e. every carbon atom in the chain is attached to two hydrogen atoms)
                MONO-UNSATURATED fatty acids have one carbon-carbon double bond
                POLY-UNSATURATED fatty acids have multiple carbon-carbon double bonds

            The carbon double bonds create an imbalance in electro-negativity due to the missing hydrogen atoms
            This imbalance causes the fatty acid molecule to bend
                - The result is the fatty acid molecules don't pack as closely and are therefore liquid (oil) at room temperature
                - The fatty acid molecules are held together by Van Der Waals forces, when the fatty acid molecule bends there
                  is less contact between the molecules over their length so the sum of the Van der Waals forces are reduced
