ELECRTONEGATIVITY
    The electronegativity of an atom depends on the number of protons and the distance to the outer shell
        Atoms at the left side of the periodic table have a low number of proteins and a large distance to the outer shell
        These atoms want to lose the electrons in there outer shell (low electronegativity)

        Atoms on the right side of the periodic table have a high number of protons for the same distance to the outer shell
        These atoms want to attract electrons to there outer shell (high electronegativity)
    When two atoms with different electronegativities form a covalent bond the more electronegative atom will pull the shared
    electrons closer to it giving it a small negative charge. The less electronegative atom will get a small positive charge

    Side Note:
        Q) Why does a water molecule have a bent shape
        A) As well as the two pairs of electrons which form the covalent bonds with hydrogen, oxygen also has two lone pairs of electrons
           These lone pairs are very negative and repulse the bonded electron pairs. The four sets of pairs settle in a tetrahedron shape
           since this is the 3D shape where the 4 pairs are furthest from each other


TYPES OF BONDS
    We measure the strength of a bond as the amount of energy to break the bond
    The random fluctuations of energy due to thermal activity at room temperature are about 0.6 Kcal/mol
    Long molecules are held together by covalent bond. The shape of the molecules depends on the hydrogen and Van der Waals Forces

    COVALENT BOND
        Bonds that form between two atoms
        Covalent bonds are the result of atoms sharing electrons
        Atoms with a low difference in electronegativity tend to form covalent bonds
        These are the strongest types of bonds
        Covalent bonds can be single, double or triple bonds (1, 2, or 3 pairs of electrons shared)
        Strength of single covalent bond is 80 Kcal/mol

        POLAR COVALENT BOND
            Polar covalent bonds are when two atoms of different elements form covalent bonds
            Since the atoms have different electronegativity one atom will cling to it's electrons more tightly
            This causes a positive charge on one side of the bond and a negative charge on the other side
            Water molecules are a good example of a polar molecule resulting from a polar covalent bond

        NON-POLAR COVALENT BOND
            Non-polar bonds occur when two atoms of the same element, or elements with similar elecronegativities bond
            In this case the charge on either side of the bond is the same
            Non-polar covalent bonds will not form hydrogen bonds between molecules

    IONIC BOND
        Ionic bonds from between two atoms with a large difference in elctronegativity
        The difference in electronegativity causes one atom to loss an electron to another atom
        The atom that loses the electron becomes a positive ion and the atom that gains the electron becomes a negative ion
        These oppositely charged ions are then attracted to each other
        Ionic bonds are not as strong as covalent bonds

    HYDROGEN BOND
        Hydrogen bonds are bonds formed between two molecules which contain polar covalent bonds
        The polar bonds cause one side of each molecule to have a small positive charge and one side of each molecule to have a small negative charge
        The opposite charges attract each other creating a weak bond between the two molecules
        Strength of a hydrogen bond is 5 Kcal/mol

    VAN DER WAALS FORCES
        Very weak bonds between molecules
        Electrons are constantly moving within their atoms. This movement cause temporary positive and negative charges to appear on the
        sides of the atom. These temporary charges cause the atoms to be attracted to each other. Large amounts of these forces together
        can create significant forces
        These bonds are what allow geckos to cling to walls
        Strength of a Van Der Waals forces is 1 Kcal/mol

    HYDROPHOBIC FORCES
        Polar and non-polar molecules won't form hydrogen bonds with each other
        Since polar molecules, such as water, want to form bonds with each other they will force the non-polar molecules away
        It is energetically unfavourable for non-poloar molecules to be amongst  polar molecules (i.e. oil and water)
        Polar molecules are therefore hydrophilic and non-polar molecules are hydrophobic

    CONDENSATION REACTION
        Two molecules combine and a water molecule is excreted

    HYDROLYSIS REACTION
        A water molecule reacts with a polymer molecule to break the bond formed by a condensation reaction
