    POST:       Power on self test

COMMANDS
    enable:                                 access enabled mode
    configure terminal:                     access global configuration mode

    reload:                                 reboot the switch. Loads startup-config into RAM as running-config
    show process:                           Show the switches CPU utilization
    hostname <hostname>:                    Set the hostname on the switch
    banner motd <~message~>:                Set a message of the day banner when a user logs into the switch
    banner login <~message~>                Same as above

    exit:                                   Brings you down one level
    end:                                    Return to enabled mode
    Ctrl-z:                                 Return to enabled mode
    quit:                                   Exits the user from the CLI session

    enable secret <password>                Sets a password for entering enabled mode
    no ip domain-lookup:                    Stops switch from checking for a domain when it receives a command it doesn't recognise
    service password-encryption:            Encrypts passwords in the running-config and startup-config files
    show nvram                              Same as show startup-config

    erase nvram:                            Erases the startup-config in NVRAM (will allow access to setup mode)
    setup                                   Enter setup mode



DEFINITIONS:
    Internetwork Operation System (IOS)     -> common operating system on Cisco devices
    Catalyst operation System (Cat OS)      -> Legacy Operating system


STARTING A SWITCH
    Switches can be used as soon as they are plugged in
        - Generally they have no power button
        - Generally all interfaces are enabled and in VLAN 1 by default


SWITCH INTERFACES

    FastEthernet 0/4        10/100 interface
    GigabitEthernet 0/8     10/10/1000 interface


SWITCH LEDs

    There are 5 system LEDs and one LED associated to each port

    1. SYST (system):
          OFF:          Switch is not powered on
          ON(GREEN):    Switch is powered on an working
          ON(AMBER):    Switch is powered on but failed to load IOS (Filed POST)

    2. RPS (Redundant power supply):         Shows the status of the second power supply

    3. STAT (Status):
          If green implies that each port LED shows the ports status
                OFF:                  The link is not working
                ON(SOLID GREEN):      The Link is working but there is no traffic currently over it
                ON(FLASHING GREEN):   The link is working and there is traffic over it
                ON(FLASHING AMBER):   The interface is administratively or dynamically (i.e. STP) disabled

    4. DUPLX (duplex):
          If green implies that each port LED shows the ports duplex status
                OFF:  Half Duplex
                ON:   Full Duplex

    5. SPEED:
          if GREEN implies that each port LED shows the ports speed
                OFF:            10 Mbps
                ON(SOLID):      100 Mbps
                ON(FLASHING):   1000 Mbps


CONFIGURATION MODES
    User Mode:                            lowest mode, allows some show commands, entrance point for all login methods
    Enabled Mode:                         Privileged mode, allows user to make changes and reboot the switch. May require a password to access
    Global Configuration Mode:            Make changes which affect all aspects of a switch (i.e. update mac address table)
    Interface Configuration Mode:         Make changes which affect a single interface (i.e. configure speed of an interface)


CLI ACCESS FROM THE CONSOLE
    Allows access to the switch even if the switch has not been connected to a network yet
    Uses a special port (RJ-45) on the switch
    We connect to the console port using a UTP rollover cable (pin1 to pin8, pin2 to pin7 etc)
    The PC accesses the switch connects to it through a terminal emulator program

        9600 bit/second
        8 bit ASCII
        1 stop bit
        No parity bit
        No hardware flow control

CLI ACCESS FROM TELNET AND SSH
    Also requires a terminal emulator program running on the connecting PC
    Connects to the switch using the switch's IP address (TCP based application)
    The switch's IP address is configured on a VLAN. Any interfaces on that VLAN can then be reached using that IP address

    Operates on port 23
    All data including the username and login password are sent in clear text

    SSH is the same as telnet except all data in encrypted
    REQUIRES USERNAME AND PASSWORD CONFIGURED ON THE SWITCH
    "login local"                         On vty interface
    "transport input {all | ssh}"         On vty interface
    Operates on port 22


PASSWORD SECURITY
    The virtual terminals are used fro connections through telnet and SSH
    Configuring SSH requires additional steps such as a username

    "line console 0"                -> configure console (from global config mode)
    "line vty 0 15"                 -> configure virtual terminals 0 to 15 (from global config mode)

    "password <password>"           -> set the password for the console or virtual terminal (from console / vty config mode)
    "login"                         -> Enable login on the interface (user must enter password to connect through this interface)

    "enable secret <password>"      -> Set a password for entering enabled mode
        NOTE: If a password (secret or password) is set for enabled mode Telnet and SSH will be prevent from reaching enabled mode
        we can still access enabled mode through the console though


HELP AND DEBUG
    The '?' is used to show a list of possible commands and command completions as well as a description of what does commands do

    The 'debug' command continues to monitor processes on the switch and then send messages to the user when events occur
    The debug command requires more of the switches CPU
    The debug command displays the messages as log messages
    Any user can view the log messages of a debug process with the "terminal monitor" command
    The log messages also get displayed to the console automatically (Anyone logged into the console will see all debug messages)

    The debug command continues until the switch is reloaded or the same command is entered prefixed with "no"
        i.e. "debug spanning-tree" is disabled with "no debug spanning-tree" or "no debug all"


CONFIGURATION MODE
    Changes made in configuration mode update the active running config (in RAM) and occur immediately

    "configure terminal"                                -> enter global configuration mode
    "interface <interface type> <interface number>"     -> configure a specific interface (i.e. interface FastEthernet 0/3)


STORING SWITCH CONFIGURATION FILES

    RAM/DRAM:           Dynamic memory, loses its configuration when powered off, stores running-config
    ROM:                Read only memory, stores bootstrap program (load IOS from flash memory to RAM), Can't be written to
    Flash Memory:       Permanent storage (usually a chip). stores the Cisco IOS
    NVRAM:              Non-volatile RAM. Permanent storage. Stores the start-up configuration file

    "show startup-config"                     -> shows the start-up config
    "show running-config"                     -> shows the running config

    "copy running-config startup-config"      -> overwrites the startup config in NVRAM with the running config

    Note: The coppy command can also be used to copy files to and from a TFTP server
        - "copy running-config tftp"
        - You will then be prompted for the address of the tftp and the name of the file
    Note: When copying a file into RAM the running config is not replaced, instead the commands in the copied file are executed as if they had been entered into the CLI


SETUP MODE
    setup mode can be entered when the switch boots with no startup-config file in NVRAM (i.e. it was erased with "erase nvram")
    Can also be entered with the "setup" command

    When completed the results of setup mode are copied to NVRAM and RAM (replace the startup-config and running-config)
    we will be asked if we want to proceded with writing results of setup mode to memory

        0:  Don't save this setup configuarion
        1   Restart setup mode
        2   Save this setup configuration to startup-config and running-config

    Ctrl-C quits setup mode and nothing is written into memory
