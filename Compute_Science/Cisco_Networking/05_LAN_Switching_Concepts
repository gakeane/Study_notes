    micro-segmentation: The process of a switch segmenting a LAN into one device er collision domain


TRANSPARENT BRIDGES (Layer 1)
    bridges create separate collision domains on either side of the bridge
    If one side of the bridge is busy the bridge will buffer any frames it needs to forward to that side


ETHERNET SWITCHES (Layer 2)
    Segment a LAN into a single device per collision domain
    Each device can use the full bandwidth of the Ethernet and operate in full Duplex mode
    Switches support rate adaptation so that devices that use different speeds can communicate through the switch

    Unicast address:        MAC address identifying a single LAN interface
    Broadcast address:      Destination address FFFF:FFFF:FFFF indicates all devices on the LAN should process the frame
    Multicast address:      Multicast MAC addresses (0100.5exx.xxxx) allow subset of a LAN to communicate

    1. Decide when to forward a frame and when to drop a frame based on destination MAC address
    2. Learning MAC addresses by examining the source MAC address of each received frame
    3. Creating a loop-free environment with other switches using Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)


FORWARD VERSUS FILTER DECISION
    Mac Address Table: A dynamically built table listing mac addresses and outgoing interfaces
    The switch filters (drops) any frames which would be sent out the same interface they came in
        - If an interface of a switch is connected to a hub which connects two hosts.
        - When these hosts communicate the source and destination MAC addresses would both be to the hub (through the same interface on the switch)

    STORE-AND-FORWARD PROCESSING
        Most common form of forward decision processing on Cisco switches
        The entire frame must be received before forwarding the first bit

    CUT-THROUGH PROCESSING
        Switch starts sending the frame out the output port(s) as soon as possible (once destination MAC address is received)
        reduces the latency in the switch
        Since the Frame Check sum (FCS) is in the trailer of the frame the switch will forward the frame before knowing if it's correct or not

    FRAGMENT-FREE PROCESSING
        Forwards the frame after receiving the first 46 bytes (the amount required for CSMA/CD to detect a collision
        This means that frames with errors as a result of collisions are not forwarded


LEARNING MAC ADDRESSES
    Switches build the address table by listening for incoming frames and examining their source (only) MAC address
    The source MAC address and the interface the frame came in are then added to the MAC address table
    A timer is kept for each MAC address entry in the MAC address table:
        - When a frame from this address is received the timer is reset
        - The switch will remove the oldest entries in the table if it runs out of memory
        - mac address table entries are cleared after 300 seconds

    FLOODING FRAMES
        When there is no entry for a destination MAC address in the MAC address table, the switch forwards the packet out all interfaces (except the incoming one)
        Switches flood unknown unicast addresses, broadcast addresses and multicast addresses (if multicast has not been configured on the switch)


SPANNING TREE PROTOCOL
    Spanning tree protocol blocks some interfaces from forwarding frames so that there is only a single path between any two LAN segments (collision domains / hosts)
    Spanning Tree protocol does not load balance the network
    All switches must implement STP for it to function

    Note: When an interface is blocked both send and receiving frames on that interface is prevented
    Note: Spanning tree protocol works the same for a bridge or a switch


BENEFITS OF NETWORKING DEVICES

    1. Greater cabling distance:      Hub, Switch, Router
    2. Multiple collision domains:    Switch, Router
    3. Increased Bandwidth:           Switch, Router
    4. Multiple Broadcast domains:    Router


VIRTUAL LANS (VLANS)
    When no VLANs a configured the switch considers all interfaces to be in the default VLAN (VLAN 1)
    The switch can create multiple broadcast domains by placing different interfaces into different VLANS
        - Each VLAN is it's own broadcast domain
        - A router is required to move traffic from one VLAN to another (router on a stick)

    ADVANTAGES OF VLANS
        - Group users based on department rather than physical location
        - Better security by having hosts that work with sensitive data on a separate VLAN
        - Separate traffic sent by an IP phone (VoIP) from traffic sent by a PC
        - Reduce number of switches required by using one switch for several LANs

    To move VLAN traffic between switches we use a trunk link
        - Here the traffic for all VLANs is passed between switches over a single link

    EXTENDED VLANS
        VLANS 2 to 1001 are the standard VLANS
        VLANS 1006 to 4094 are the extended VLANS (require transparent bridge)
        VLANS 1, 1002 - 1005 are special VLANS


CAMPUS LANS
    These are large LANs which Span many buildings and can have 100s of hosts

    Core Switches:                Connect to distribution switches (not always present in smaller Campus LANs)
    Distribution Switches:        Connect to Access switches
    Access switches:              Connect to host devices

    Generally an access switch will have two links to a distribution switch for redundancy
