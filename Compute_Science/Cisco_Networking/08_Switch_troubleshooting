CISCO DISCOVERY PROTOCOL (CDP)
    Proprietary protocol on cisco devices allows them to discover basic information about other Cisco devices attached to them
    Routers and switches send out CDP messages announcing information about themselves. Other routers and switches can then listen for these messages

    THINGS THAT CAN BE LEARNED
        1. Device Identifier                      the hostname of the neighbour device
        2. Address List                           The Network and data-link (MAC) address of the neighbour device
        3. Local Interface                        The interface on the local device that received the CDP message from a neighbour
        4. Port Identifier                        Port used by neighbouring device to send CDP messages to the local device
        5. Capabilities List                      device type (i.e. switch, router)
        6. Platform                               model and OS of the running device

    The "show cdp" command is used to display the contents of CDP packets received from neighbouring devices
        1. "show cdp neighbours"                                              Lists summary line of information for each neightbour
        2. "show cdp neighbours detail"                                       Large amount of information (15 lines) about each neighbour
        3. "show cdp neighbours <interface type> <interface number>"          Lists a summary line about neighbours connected to a specific interface
        4. "show cdp entry <name>"                                            Lists detailed information for a named (hostname) neighbour

    It is recommended that CDP be disabled as it provides a security risk
        - disabled per interface using the "no cdp enable" interface command
        - Globally disable with "no cdp run" global configuration command

    The following commands give information about the CDP protocol running on the switch
        1. "show cdp"
        2. "show cdp interfaces"
        3. "show cdp traffic"

    CDP advertisements are sent out every 60 seconds
    CDP advertisements are held for 180 seconds

    LLDP (Link layer discovery protocol) is an IEEE implementation of CDP


INTERFACE STATUS CODES
    The "show interfaces" and "show interfaces description" commands can be used to show the status codes of an interface
    The two status codes are line status and protocol status
        line status:        Is layer 1 working
        protocol status:    Is layer 2 working

    "clear counters interface fastEthernet 0/1" can be used to clear the errors counters on an interface
    The "show interface status" command shows a different status, but which corresponds to the combined state of the line status and the protocol status

        disabled:         down/down (administratively down)                     "shutdown" used on interface
        notconnect:       down/down                                             Layer 1 not working (i.e. wrong/missing cable, speed mismatch, other device is off)
        notconnect:       up/down                                               Layer 2 not working (very rare)
        err-disabled      down/down (switchport security violation)             Interface shutdown due to port security violation
        connect           up/up                                                 interface is working


SPEED AND DUPLEX ISSUES
    The "speed" command can be used to manually set the speed of an interface
    The "duplex" command can be used to manually set an interface to full or half duplex
    NOTE: Setting both the speed and duplex setting on an interface will disable auto-negotiation for that interface (ONLY IF BOTH SET)
            - Other devices (switches) will not be able to determine the spped/duplex setting of the interface through auto-negotiate
            - "show interface status" command shows if speed and duplex setting were learned with auto-negotiation by prefixing them with an 'a-'
            - The show interfaces command does not indicate how speed and duplex settings were learned

    With auto-negotiation both devices agree to the fastest speed (and duplex mode) supported by both devices
    The following rules are used when connecting to a device which has auto-negotiate disabled
        1. If speed is unknown use 10 Mbps, half duplex
        2. If speed is known to be 10 Mbps or 100 Mbps use half duplex
        3. If speed is known to be 1000 Mbps use full duplex

    A switch will know the speed of an interface it's connecting to if it's speed setting (on the local switch) was manually configured
    Cisco switches can also sense the speed of connected devices due to the electrical signals on the line

    In the case of a duplex mismatch the link still works (up/up) but performance will be poor
        - This is because devices operating in half duplex mode use CSMA/CD and will wait to send while receiving a frame from the full-duplex device
        - The device in full duplex mode will not wait thus causing the device in half-duplex mode to perceive errors

    High collisions indicates both sides are using half duplex
    High late collision count indicates there is a duplex mismatch
    If there are no collisions and the interface is down it is likely a wiring issue

PROBLEMS ON INTERFACES IN UP/UP STATE

    CRC CHECK
        Even when an interface is in up/up state there can be problems sending packets
        This could occur due to a damaged cabled or electromagnetic interference causing bits to flip in transit
        This causes the CRC/FCS to be incorrect and the frame is dropped

            "show interfaces" command tracks how many packets have been dropped due to a CRC error on each interface and the number of late collisions

    COLLISIONS
        When in half duplex mode collision normally do occur, however if everything is operating correctly collisions should be detected within the first 64 bytes of transmission
        A late collision is one that occurs after this and indicates that one of the devices is not obeying CSMA/CD

    COMMON LAN PROBLEMS
        1. Interference on a cable              CRC error count increases but not collisions
        2. Duplex mismatch                      Late collision count grows large
        3. Jabber                               When an interface ignores Ethernet rules and keeps sending out frames

    NOTE: Late collisions can also mean that the length of Ethernet cable used is too long
    NOTE: Large number of collisions can also indicate a DoS attack


FRAME PATHS

    "show mac address-table"                displays all entries in the mac address table
    "show mac address-table dynamic"        displays all dynamically learned mac addresses

    Some entries in the mac-address table list the outgoing port as 'CPU'. Frames from these mac addresses are sent to the switches CPU

    A switch will only send frames out interfaces in the same VLAN (and trunk links) as the interface the frame arrived on.
    You will need to use "show vlan brief" to check which VLAN different interfaces are on


PORT SECURITY AND FILTERING

    Switches have ACLs (access control lists) which filter incoming frames based on some filter rule (These are not covered here)
    Frames can also be filtered if they violate port security

    "switchport port-security mac-address 0050.3e8d.6400"       Configure an interface to only except frames with the source address 0050.3e8d.6400
