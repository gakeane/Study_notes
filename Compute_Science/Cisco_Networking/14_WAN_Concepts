DEFINITIIONS
    Local Loop:         This is the line that connects a modem to the telco (i.e. a telephone line)
    Metro E:            Using Ethernet as a WAN technology

WAN TECHNOLOGIES

    1. leased lines -> HDLC (High Level Data Link Control) or PPP (Point to Point Protocol)
    2. Frame relay


PUBLIC SWITCHED TELEPHONE NETWORK (PSTN)

    This refers to the equipment and devices ALL telcos (telephone company) use to connect any two phones in the world
    Modems and DSL use this network to access the internet

ANALOGUE MODEMS
    Allows computers to send and receive data (stream of bits) over the electrical circuit used by two phones
    Can be used anywhere a phone line is installed
    Modem - modulation and demodulation
        Modulation:     Change a string of bits into an electrical signal that's sent to the PSTN
        Demodulation:   Change an electrical signal from the PSTN to a string of bits (by sampling it every 1/9600 seconds as either a 0 or 1)

    The user has a modem connected to their PC (either internal or external modem)
    The telco has a large bank of modems which the user connects to by dialling the phone number for them (dial-up modem)

    A connection between two modems is like a leased line
    Modems use asynchronous clocking (They don't adjust their clock to match the speed of the modem at the other end of the line)

    ADVANTAGES
        - No limit on distance
        - No loss of through put due to high loads from other users

    PROBLEMS
        - Slow: Maximum bit rate roughly 100 kbps
        - Can't talk on the phone and use the modem for connection at the same time


DIGITAL SUBSCRIBER LINE (DSL)
    1. Allows analogue voice and digital data to be sent over the same physical wiring at the same time
        - Phone:  frequencies less than 4000 Hz
        - DSl:    frequencies greater than 4000 Hz
    2. The wiring is connected to a DSL access multiplexer (DSLAM) at the CO, instead of a traditional voice switch
        - This separates the Analogue voice traffic and the IP traffic
    3. DSL is always on. i.e. you don't have to dial a modem at the ISP to get connection
    4. Connects to telco/ISP via standard telephone cable through a DSL modem (RJ-11)

    Generally you pay an ISP a monthly few for DSL access and the ISP works with the telco
        - The Telco owns the DLSAM (multiplexer)
        - The IP traffic is sent to the ISP's router

    Symmetric DSL:    Link speed in both directions is the same (upload and download)
    asymmetric DSL:   Link speed is greater in one direction than the other


    SPEEDS
        Greater distance to the telco and the quality of the wiring affects DSL speed
        ADSL generally runs at 1.5 Mbps downstream and 384 kbps upstream

    PROBLEMS
        DSL has a maximum range of 18000 feet (5,000 meters)


CABLE INTERNET (CATV)
    Provides always on service (like DSL) where you can use the internet and watch TV
    Runs over a coaxial cable used to supply TV service
    Uses some of the capacity (that would be used for another TV channel) to carry IP data

    Cable TV sends all the channels to you at once. you then choose which one to watch
        - This allows multiple TVs to watch different channels since all the channels are actually arriving

    The cable modem simply connects to the cable wall jack
        - cable modem connects to the PC over Ethernet
    The DSLAM is replaced by a device called a Head-end (which splits the TV signals and IP traffic)
    Cable Internet is always asymmetric

    ADVANTAGES
        Cable internet is 2-5 times faster than DSL
        Cable signals do not degrade with the length of the cable

    DISADVANTAGE
        Cable speeds drop when lots of users are using the service
            - Cables lines are shared since they all provide the same TV signals to each house

ASYNCHRONOUS TRANSFER MODE (ATM)
    Routers connect to an ATM switch inside the service providers network via an access link (same as frame relay)
    Also considered a type of packet switching service

    DIFFERENCE WITH FRAME RELAY
        1. Much higher speed
        2. Sends cells (instead of frames), these are always 53 bytes
            - 5 byte header
            - 48 byte payload

        Two fields in the header (VCI (Virtual channel Identifier) and VPI (Virtual Path Identifier)) act as the DLCI (data link connection identifier)
            - i.e. the address in Frame relay

        Segmentation:   Router receives and Ethernet frame and splits it into 48 byte chunks to be used with ATM (i.e. ATM requires a router)
        Reassembly:     Router at the other end reassembles the ethernet frame
        SAR:            Segmentation and Reassembly


CIRCUIT SWITCHING VS PACKET SWITCHING
    Circuit Switching:      Layer 1       Point-to-point
    Packet Switching:       Layer 2       Multipoint (frames can be sent to multiple locations)


ACCESS ROUTERS

    An access router sits at the front of a home network and provides three functions
        1. Address assignment (i.e. DHCP server for home LAN)
        2. Network Address Translation (NAT)
        3. Learn Routes

    ACCESS ROUTER PROCEDURE
        - PC sends packet to default gateway (the access router)
        - The access router forwards the packet to the ISP router as the next hop router
        - The ISP router has a routing table for all routes on the internet
        - The modem converts the digital signal to an analogue signal so it can be sent to the ISP router

    ADDRESS ASSIGNMENT
        - IP address on internet facing interface needs to be a public IP address to be on the internet (assigned by ISP using DHCP)
        - IP address on the local interface needs to be statically configured
        - Access router works as DHCP server for local PCS
              - These will be assigned in the same subnet as the statically configured IP address on the router

    LEARNING ROUTES
        - Since the access router has only one possible destination it can use a default route
        - Creates a default route which is the same as the default gateway (ISP router) it learned through DHCP
            - All packets are forwarded to the ISP router

    NETWORK ADDRESS TRANSLATION (NAT)
        - All hosts on the private LAN will access the internet through the access routers public IP address
        - Return packets will be addressed to the access router
        - It will then translate the destination IP address to the private IP address of the correct host PC

        1. PC1 192.168.1.101 sends a packet to server 128.107.1.1 through it's access router 192.168.4.1 using port 1024
        2. PC2 192.168.4.102 also sends a packet to server 128.107.1.1 through 192.168.4.1 using port 1024
        3. When both packets arrive at the router it recreates the packets using it's public IP address as the destination address
        4. The router then sends the packets to server 128.107.1.1, each on a different port
            - the mapping for each PC IP address and port to the IP address and port the router uses to forward the packets is stored in the NAT translation table
            - When the server replys the Router will know which PC to pass the packets onto based on the port the server replied on (the source port of the segment)

        NAT: Translation of just IP addresses
        PAT: Translation of IP address and ports

        Inside Host:            Host on the local LAN
        Inside Local:           Packet passing over the local LAN
        Inside Global:          Packet from an inside host passing over the internet with a NAT translated IP address
        Inside Interface:       LAN facing interface on the router
        Outside Interface:      Internet facing interface on the router
