AD-HOC MODE
    Wireless device communicates with a small number of other devices for a short period of time

INFRASTRUCTURE MODE:

    Each device communicates with an access point connected to a wired Ethernet (allows connection to the internet)
    In infrastructure mode devices can't send frames directly to each other. Instead they send them to the wireless access point which forwards the frames

        Basic Service Set (BSS):            Single Access point
        Extended Service Set (ESS):         Multiple access points forming overlapping cells to cover wider area (Same LAN/WLAN)


LAYER 1
    Data sent using radio waves created and received through an antenna
    The frequency of the radio waves is the most important property with respect to wireless transmissions
    To encode 0s and 1s onto a signal we can modulate either the frequency, amplitude or phase

    The larger the frequency band the greater the amount of information that can be transfered
        200 kHz required for a radio station
        4.5 MHz required for a TV station

    Some frequency bands are licensed so that only the person with the license is allowed broadcast on them (i.e. radio station)
    Some frequency bands are unlicensed so that anyone can broadcast on them provided the power levels are below some threshold (i.e. a microwave)
        - Microwaves create electromagnetic waves at 2.4 GHz
        - Some WLAN standards and mobile phones also use this frequency range so the microwave may interfere with them

    1. 900 MHz    Industrial, Scientific, Medical (ISM)               old mobile phones
    2. 2.4 GHz    ISM                                                 802.11, 802.11b, 802.11g, new mobiles phones
    3. 5.0 GHz    Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure      802.11a 802.11n, new mobile phones


FREQUENCY HOPPING SPREAD SPECTRUM (FHSS)
    Used by the original 802.11 standard
    Hops between the different frequencies in it's band to try and avoid interference from other devices


DIRECT SEQUENCE SPREAD SPECTRUM (DSSS)
    Designed to be used with the 2.4 GHz band
    Uses 11 different overlapping frequency channels, each 82 MHz wide ranging from 2.402 GHz to 2.483 GHz
    3 of these channels do not overlap with each other. (The far left (1), far right (11) and centre(6))

    When designing an ESS (multiple overlapping coverage zones) each zone should use a different non-overlapping channel
    This allows the access point in each ESS zone to transmit (at 11 Mbps) without interfering with other Access Points
    Typical of 802.11b and 802.11g WLANS

ORTHOGONAL FREQUENCY DIVISION MULTIPLEXING (OFDM)
    Also uses multiple non-overlapping frequency bands
    Typical of 802.11a, 802.11n and 802.11g WLANs

    802.11n also uses multiple antennas (multiple input, multiple output (MIMO))


WIRELESS INTERFERENCE
    Large areas of metal scatter and reflect WiFi radio waves
    Matter partially absorbs WiFi radio waves (i.e. the shielding on a microwave)
    Other radio waves at the same frequency will interfere with a WiFi signal
        - Signal to noise ratio (SNR) measures the strength of the signal against the noise on the signal


    The coverage area of an Access Point depends on the power of the access point
    Installing high gain antennas would increase the coverage area by increasing the power (may not be legal)
        - quadruple power will double the coverage area
    Power of an access point is measured based on Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP)

        - Placing an AP on a large metal filing cabinet increases scattering and decreases coverage area

    WLAN standard support different speeds based on the strength of the signal a communicating device receives
        - A device near the AP can communicate at the highest speed (11 Mbps on 802.11b)
        - A device at the edge of the coverage will communicate at the slowest speed (1 Mbps on 802.11b)

    Generally speaking WLAN standards that use higher frequencies can send data faster but have a smaller coverage area


LAYER 2
    It is impossible for wireless signals to be separated from each other the same way Ethernet LANs are
    As such all wireless devices must use the CSMA/CD algorithm
        - Unfortunately a sending device can not know if it's frame suffered a collision.
        - The standards all require an acknowledgement of every frame
        - A sending device listens for an acknowledgement after each frame. If it does not receive one it will resend the frame

    NOTE: CSMA/CD is slightly different with the wireless standard. Once the medium is free the device will wait a random amount of time
    to reduce the possibility of two devices trying to send at the same time
        - Could hog the network by having your device not wait


WLAN IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

    1. Confirm existing wired network works (VLANs, DHCP, Internet Connectivity)
        - Ensure all interfaces that will connect to a wireless access point on a switch are in their own VLAN

    2. Install access point, configure it's IP address, gateway and network mask (and DNS server), Confirm it's connectivity with the wired network
        - Access Points are like switches so the IP address is only so it can be managed remotely
        - straight-through cable to connect to a switch

    3. Configure the APs wireless settings (Service Set Identifier (SSID))
        - choose wireless standard (a, b, g, n, or multiple) - mixed standards tend to slow the WLAN down
        - choose wireless channel
        - choose transmit power
        - Service set Identifier (SSID) 32 character text identifying the WLAN (all APs in an ESS should have the same SSID)

    4. Install one Wireless client (i.e. a laptop with integrated WiFi NIC) and confirm it can connect to the wireless network
        - By default the laptop NIC should try to discover all Access Points by listening on all frequencies on all channels
        - The client also learns the SSID of an access point automatically (so it can use the strongest access point of an ESS)
        - Many laptops have a switch which enables/disables the WiFi NIC

    5. Configure Wireless security on the AP client
    6. Verify everything still works


SITE SURVEY
    Process of finding a suitable point for an access point

        - AP should be at the centre of where the clients will reside
        - AP/clinet should not be near a large amount of metal
        - AP/clinet should not be near a microwave or gaming station (wireless controller + headset)
        - Dies the coverage area reach the client

        - Ensure AP has the latest firmware (OS)
        - Ensure the channel the AP is using dose not overlap with the channel of another AP in the same location


WIRELESS LAN SECURITY

    ATTACKERS
        War Drivers:      People who want free internet (drive around looking for open access points). Use high gain directional antennas               (strong authentication)
        Hackers:          Access information or deny service. Access wired network without having to go through internet connections (firewalls)        (encryption + authentication)
        Employees:        Installing their own access point. No security (access), No encryption (information)                                          (intrusion detection system)
        Rouge AP:         Attacker gained information about legitimate AP. Sets up their own AP tricking users into connecting to it                    (authentication + intrusion detection)


    PRECAUTIONS
        Mutual Authentication:        Cryptographic key exchange (key is never actually transmitted). Both AP and client confirm who the other is
        Encryption:                   Prevents an attacker reading the contents of a frame
        Intrusion tools:              Structured Wireless-Aware Network (SWAN), Intrusion detection systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)

    SECURITY STANDARDS
        WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)          1997
        Interim Cisco Solution                  2001
        WPA (WiFi Protected Access)             2003
        802.11i (WPA2)                          2005        (The currently used standard)

    SSID Clocking
        - To connect to an access point (AP) the client must know the access points SSID
        - AP sends out a beacon announcing its SSID every 100 ms
        - The client learns the APs SSID from the beacon message
        - The client can now connect with the AP with the strongest signal for a desired SSID
        - The Beacon allows an attacker to find out information about an AP

        - SSID clocking prevents the AP from sending out these beacon messages
        - A Client can send out a probe message which will make the AP respond with it's SSID
        - Enterprises sometimes use SSID clocking to keep their network hidden from the general public

    MAC ADDRESS FILTERING
        - Access point will drop any packet from a MAC address that isn't in a list of allowed MAC addresses
        - An attacker can get around this by listening to actual traffic and copying the MAC address from this traffic as their own


WEP PROBLEMS
    1. Static Keys:       No dynamic key exchange meant users had to manually change keys
    2. Small Keys:        Keys were only 64 bits and could be broken with brute force attacks

CISCO SOLUTION
    1. Dynamic Key Exchange
    2. New Key for each packet:       If a key is discovered it will only decrypt that one packet
    3. User authentication:           Username and password must be supplied to get access to the WiFi

WPA (WiFI PROTECTED ACCESS)
    Pretty much identical to the Cisco solution

802.11i
    - Same as WPA
    - Uses AES as encryption much stronger with longer keys



WIRELESS LAN CONTROLLER (WLC)
    Data on a wireless network is split into two types:
        1. Data Plane:            Wireless client activity
        2. Control Plane:         Management data between access points

    - WLC gathers all the control plane data and uses it to manage the wireless access points (usually Lightweight access points (LAP))
    - Allows seamless transitions between access points with the same SSID
    - Ensures all new wireless access points discovered by the WLC have the same Cisco IOS (Allows for uniform support and features)

    Allows several access points to work as a single network (ESS)
    Responsible for centralised authentication of users on a wireless network (clients can roam between access points and maintain authentication)
    Also makes it easier to assign SSIDs and VLANs to wireless access points

LIGHTWEIGHT ACCESS POINT (LAP/LWAP)
    Must be connected to a wireless LAN controller (WLC)
    The lightweight means they can't act independently

AUTONOMOUS ACCESS POINTS
    These access points can act independently of a wireless LAN controller
    These are the normal access points we've covered so far
