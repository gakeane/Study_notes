DEFINITIONS
    Leased Line:                  Line owned by a telco which is rented to a company to send data over between two sites
    Point-to-Point:               Single line providing direct connection between two other sites. No other devices are connected to the line
    Four wire leased circuit:     Leased line using two twisted pairs
    Demarc:                       Where responsibility for devices transfers from the Company to the Telco (generally on Telco side of CSU/DSU)


NOTE: Switches generally only have Ethernet ports. Connecting to WANs generally involves going through a router


WAN DEVICES
    Routers connect to CSU/DSU (This connection is within the company office)
    The CSU/DSU then connects to a WAN switch (Through the four wire leased line from the Telco)
    This goes over the point-to-point leased line and to a WAN switch at the other side

    CABLING
        The connection to the CSU/DSU typically uses an RJ-48 connector
        Many routers have an integrated CSU/DSU, in this case the RJ-48 leased line is connected directly to the router


CLOCK RATES (DCE AND DTE)
    When purchasing a leased line from a Telco the company needs to specify how fast the line will be in kbps
    The CSU/DSU at each end of the line must be configured to run at the leased line's speed

    Synchronization occurs between the twos CSU/DSUs by having one CSU/DSU be a slave and match it's clock rate to the other, master CSU/DSU
    The CSU/DSU synchronise their clocks several times a second

    In practice the leased line provides clock information to the CSU/DSUs by transition in the electrical signal
    The CSU/DSUs then match their clocks to this rate
    The CSU/DSUs send the clocking information to the router so it knows how quickly to send the data

        - The router is the DTE (data terminal equipment)
        - The CSU/DSU is the DCE (data communications equipment)

    Cisco provides both DTE and DCE cables
          - DTE cable if router is acting as a DTE device (Most common on real world WAN links)
          - DCE cable if router is acting as a CDE device (needed for one router when not using CSU/DSUs)

    We can build a WAN link without CSU/DSUs. In this case one router provides clocking (DCE + DCE cable) and one receives clock (DTE + DTE cable)
        - The two cables can be connected together (male and female connector)
        - set clocking on a router with the clock rate command
        - DCE cable swaps the receive and transmit ping (like a crossover cable)


WAN SPEEDS
    PCM for voice is 8000 8 bit samples (64 kbits). This was the speed of the first digital lines provided by telcos (DS0)
    Faster lines use multiples of these base lines (i.e. DS1 uses 24 DS0s)

    DS0         64 kbps                             America
    DS1         1.544 Mbps          24 DS0s         America
    DS3         44.736 Mbps         28 DS1s         America
    E1          2.048 Mbps          32 DS0s         Europe
    E3          34.368 Mbps         16 E1s          Europe


POINT-TO-POINT PROTOCOLS

    HDLC
        - Determine if any errors occurred in transmission (error frames are dropped)
        - Determine the type of packet contained in the frame

        HEADER CONTAINS
            1 byte Flags
            1 byte Address                    Not really necessary since there is only one other device on the line
            1 byte Control
            2 byte Type (Cisco Propriety)     Identifies type of packet contained in the frame

        TRAILER CONTAINS
            4 byte checksum (FCS)

    POINT-TO-POINT PROTOCOL (PPP)
        - Same as HDLC except includes the 2 byte type field in the header as standard
        - Most popular protocol over point-to-point line


PACKET SWITCHING SERVICE
    Allows multiple routers to all be connected to eachother
    There is only a single serial link into each router connecting it to the packet switching service

    FRAME RELAY
        The routers connect directly to a frame relay switch located at the telco
            - The router is still the DTE device
            - The frame relay switch is now the DCE device
            - Note there are still CSU/DSUs which provide clocking to the router (these are also DCE devices)

        Data Link Connection Identifier (DLCI)
            - Address mechanism for frame relay frames (contained in the header)
            - The WAN switch forwards the frame based on the DLCI
            - Address are between 1 and 1023

        Virtual Circuit (VC)
            - The path a frame travels between two routers in a frame relay network
            - These are usually configured by the Telco (Permanent VC (PVC))
            - The VC acts as a point-to-point link between two routers (DTEs)
