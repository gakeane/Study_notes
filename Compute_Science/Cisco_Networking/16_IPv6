IPV6 INTERFACE

    Each interface will have a link-local address and a global unicast address
        - may have more IP addresses

    IPv6 doesn't use broadcasts
        - it just uses unicast and multicast

    IPv6 also has anycast
        - Place the same address on more than one device
        - The packet will go to one of these devices
        - We use this when we don't care which machine uses the packet (i.e. load balancing multiple servers hosting the same content)

    LINK_LOCAL UNICAST ADDRESS
        Link local addresses are IP addresses that are only valid in the local network (broadcast domain)
        The addresses are generally assigned automatically through stateless address auto-configuration
        The address is usually assigned based on the interfaces MAC address (ensures uniqueness)
        Routers do not forward packets from link local addresses

        In IPv4 the address range (169.254.0.0/16 is reserved for link local addresses)
            - APIPA assigns these addresses automatically in IPv4
        IPv6 Uses the address block fe80::/10 for link local addresses
            - a group of zeros can be represented with a '::' so FE80:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000 becomes FE80::

        Link local addresses are required on every interface that the IPv6 protocol is enabled on
            - IPv6 interfaces will generally have two IP addresses, a link local address and a rotatable address
        In IPv6 the link local address is used to run the neighbour discovery protocol (NTP)
            - Used as port of stateless auto-configuration
            - This protocol operates at the data link layer
            - Handles ARP, ICMP (ping), router discovery and router redirect (equivalents)

    GLOBAL UNICAST ADDRESSES


IPv6 ADDRESSES
    8 fields with 16 bits each (4 hex values) -> 128 bits

        1. First four fields (16 hex values / 64 bits):                 Network portion
        2. Last four fields (16 hex values / 64 bits):                  Host Portion (You should always have 64 bits for hosts)
        3. The forth field is used for sub-netting                      Allows an organisation another 64,000 unique networks


STATELESS AUTO-CONFIGURATION

    Interface first creates a link local address
        1. The network portion (64 bits) of the address is FE80:0000:0000:0000
        2. The host portion (64 bits) of address is the interfaces MAC address (48 bits) with FFFE (16 bits) in the centre of the MAC address
        3. This address only works on the local network, and can be used to contact the local router
              - The router uses the FF02::1 multicast address to advertise itself                     (ICMP 134)
              - The FF02::2 multicast address is used to request routers to identify themselves       (ICMP 133)

    Process for interfaces to automatically learn link local and global unicast addresses
        1. Interface first learns Network address from a router (first 64 bits)
        2. Host portion (64 bits) of address is the interfaces MAC address (48 bits) with FFFE (16 bits) in the centre of the MAC address
              - this is called the interface ID

    STATEFUL AUTO-CONFIGURATION
        Uses an IPv6DHCP server to assign IP addresses


IPV6 HEADER
    40 bytes long (can't vary)
        1. Version
        2. Class
        3. Flow Label
        4. Payload Length
        5. Next Header                  Equivalent of protocol field
        6. Hop Limit:                   Equivalent of time to live field
        7. Source Address
        8. Destination Address

    Extension header used for Fragmentation:                  Additional bytes for additional header info
    Next header field replaces protocol field:                The protocol the IP packet is carrying)


NEIGHBOUR DISCOVERY PROTOCOL
    ARP is replaced with a multicast address called the solicited node address

    Router Advertisement:         FF02::1             (ICMP 134)            Reply from a router advertising itself
    Router Discovery:             FF02::2             (ICMP 133)            Request routers on network to identify themselves
    Neighbour Solicitation:                           (ICMP 135)            Similar to ping

    Duplicate address detection:        Prevent interface from being assigned the same IPv6 address as another interface on the network


IPV6 ROUTER CONFIGURATION
    1. Go to global configuration mode              "configure terminal"
    2. Enable IPv6 Routing                          "ipv6 unicast-routing"
    3. Add ipv6 address to each interface           "ipv6 address 2001:0Db8:C34D:0011::/64 eui-64"          (note the subnet ID is 0011)
                                                    "ipv6 address 2001:0Db8:C34D:0012::/64 eui-64"          (note the subnet ID is 0012)
                                                    "ipv6 address 2001:0Db8:C34D:0013::/64 eui-64"          (note the subnet ID is 0013)

    3b. Instead of assigning our own IPv6 address we can issue "ipv6 address autoconfig default"
            - This will tell the router to find another router out that interface and use it's network portion (prefix)

    4. Check IP addresses are correct               "show ipv6 interface brief"

    NOTE that since IPv6 has no network and broadcast addresses we can use all 0s and all 1s has hosts
    EUI_64 means we use the MAC address and insert FFFE in the middle to make the 64 bit host address portion

    ADD IPV6 ROUTE TO ROUTING TABLE
        ipv6 route 2001:1234:0:1::/64   2001:0DB8:0043:0091::1
        ipv6 route <destination subnet> <IPv6 address of interface>             (Could also use the interface name i.e. FastEthernet 0/1)

        Default Route:    "ipv6 route ::/0 FastEthernet 0/1"

        "show ipv6 route"                                                       (View IPv6 Routing table)

    NOTE: To enable RIP on an interface for IPv6 go to an interface and enter "ipv6 rip 1 enable"


EUI_64
    The MAC address is split into 2 24 bit chunks (the OUI and the NIC specific portion)
    The FFFE value is inserted between the two MAC address chunks
    Finally the 7th bit from the left is inverted
          - If the result of this is 0 the address may not be globally unique
          - If the result of this is 1 the address is globally unique
