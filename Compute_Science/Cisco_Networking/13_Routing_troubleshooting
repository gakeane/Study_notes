NOTES:
    Note: When choosing a route where there are multiple possible routes to the same destination in the routing table. The router chooses the most specific route
            - The router chooses the router with the largest netmask



RESERVED NETWORKS
    The following networks are reserved and should never be used to assign IP addresses

    0.0.0.0/8                     -> broadcast network
    127.0.0.0/8                   -> loop-back network
    224.0.0.0/8 -> 239.0.0.0/8    -> Multicast IP addresses
    240.0.0.0/8 -> 255.0.0.0/8    -> Experimental IP addresses

    Additionally we should never use the smallest (network address) and largest (broadcast address) addresses in a sub-network
     - The subnet 172.20.40.8/12 has network number 172.16.0.0 and broadcast 172.31.255.255, these should not be assigned as IP addresses to machines
       on this subnet

    Sometimes the zero subnet and the broadcast subnet of a classful network must not be used to assign IP addresses
     - The class A network 15.40.100.20 has zero subnet 15.0.0.0 and broadcast subnet 15.255.255.255. These should not be used to assign IP addresses
       if the "no ip subnet-zero" command is configured on a router or if the router is using routing protocol RIP-V1


MICROSOFT WINDOWS TROUBLESHOOT COMMANDS

    - ipconfig /all                 -> information about interfaces (IP address, mask, gateway and DNS server)
    - ipconfig /release             -> Releases all DHCP IP addresses
    - ipconfig /renew               -> Acquires an IP address using DHCP
    - ipconfig /displaydns          -> Show all the hosts in the DNS (hostname) cache
    - ipconfig /flushdns            -> flushes the DNS (hostname) cache

    - nslookup <host name>          -> Send a DNs request for a specified host
    - netstat -rn                   -> Show the hosts routing table

    - arp -a                        -> list the arp cache
    - arp -d                        -> flushes the ARP cache


CISCO IOS TROUBLESHOOT COMMANDS

    - ping                      -> used to check connectivity between two IP machines using an ICMP echo reply request
    - show ip arp               -> list the content of the routers ARP cache (use to confirm LAN connectivity),
                                   The Age entry in the ARP cache shows the amount of time since a packet was last received from that MAC address
                                   If the Age entry is a '-' then taht MAC address is an interface on the router
                                   Entries are removed from the arp cache after 240 seconds
    - traceroute <ip Address>   -> Shows the IP addresses of the machines for all hops to a host (and the IP address of the destination host)
                                   Also shows that amount of time taken to reach each hop (time is from when the traceroute command was issued)
                                   If the traceroute command does not complete if will still list all the hops up to the point it could no longer proceed
    - telnet                    -> Cisco IOS also provides the telnet command allowing you to telnet from one router to another (forming a chain)
    - suspend                   -> This will detach from the current telnet session (while keeping it open) so that you can start a new one
    - show sessions             -> shows all the active telnet sessions (The session marked with an '*' is the last active session)
    - resume <session id>       -> Reattach to an active telnet session, If the session ID is not provided the session marked with an '*' is resumed
                                   Note that typing '2' does the same as 'resume 2'
    - disconnect <session id>   -> terminates the session identified by the session ID

    - ssh -l <username> <ip address>        -> Establish an SSH session
    - show ssh                              -> lists the users logged into the router using SSH
    - show users                            -> lists the users logged into the router using either SSH, Telnet of the console



TIPS FOR EXAM QUESTIONS

    1. Check hosts on a LAN have the same network mask
    2. On Point to Point WAN check interfaces on both ends are in the same subnet
    3. Use above commands to find the routing information and IP addresses and mask on machines
    4. The cause of failure on many exam questions is to do with IP address and network mask mismatches

    5. Understand the ARP, DNS, DHCP and ICMP (ping) protocols

        - Routing: If packet's destination is on the same subnet it is sent directly, otherwise it is sent to the default gateway
        - Address assignment: DHCP can be used to assign an IP address network mask, DNS server and default gateway to an interface
        - Name resolution: DNS is used to query the IP addresses of hosts given their hostname. The result is stored in a DNS cache
        - IP to MAC resolution: ARP is used to find the MAC address of machines (other hosts or the default gateway) on the same subnet

    6. use the "show ip route <address>" command to get the route used for a specific address"
    7. When determining if an IP address is valid be sure to check if the IP address is the board cast of network address for that subnet
    8. Routers can only forward packets through an interface if it is in the up/up state
