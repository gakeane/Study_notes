    ICANN:        Internet Corporation for assigned network numbers

DEFINITIONS
    Routing:                    Forwarding layer 3 packets (L3 PDUs)
    Logical addressing:         Addresses which can be used regardless of the type of network
    Routing Protocols:          Dynamically learns routes to different subnets
    Routed Protocol:            The type of packet which is forwarded (i.e. IP)
    Path Selection:             Can refer to both routing and routing protocols

COMMANDS


ADDRESS RESOLUTION PROTOCOL (ARP)
    Used to learn the MAC address of a host given the hosts IP address and that the host is on the same sub-network
    Sends out a broadcast request asking that the host with the matching IP address respond with it's MAC address (for that interface)
    Used by routers to build the header and trailer of frames when forwarding packets (either to a host or another router)


IP HEADER
    The IP header consists of 20 bytes
    4 bytes for the source IP address
    4 bytes for the destination IP address
    1 bytes for the protocol                    Identifies the protocol contained in the data portion of the packet (i.e. TCP)
    1 byte for the time to live (TTL)           Prevents routing loops
    2 bytes for the packet length
    2 bytes for the header checksum


ROUTING PROTOCOLS
    Goal is to fill the touring table with entries to all other subnets
    Learns routes advertised by neighboring routers


CLASSES OF NETWORKS
    Routers only care about the network part (not the host part) of the address their sending a packet to (until on the same ethernet)

    CLASS A     2^8 Networks      2^24 - 2 Hosts      1.0.0.0 - 126.0.0.0
    CLASS B     2^16 Networks     2^16 - 2 Hosts      128.0.0.0 - 191.255.0.0
    CLASS C     2^24 Networks     2^8 - 2 Hosts       192.0.0.0 - 223.255.255.0

    The network portion followed by all zeros (binary form) is the network address
    The network portion followed by all ones (binary form) is the broadcast address
    neither can be assigned as host IP addresses

    Packets sent to a broadcast address are sent to all devices on that network
    ICANN is responsible for assigning class A, B and C networks to companies and organizations ensure they IP address on the internet are repeated

SUBNETTING
    Takes a Class A, B or C network and divides it into a group of smaller networks
    Given a class B network we could use the third octet as a subnet mask allowing for 256 networks each with 254 host IP addresses
        This third octet would be called the subnet part

    classful addressing:        We consider three parts of the IP address (network, subnet and host)
    classless addressing:       We consider two parts of the IP address (combined network and subnet part, and the host part)

    In classless addressing the first part is often called the prefix and is the portion responsible for routing
    The subnet mask defines the part of the IP address which is the prefix
        - If no network mask is defined it is assumed that the prefix is the same as the class of network


IP ROUTING
    All IP addresses in the same group must not be separated by a router
    All IP addresses in different groups must be separated by a router

    1. If host is in the same subnet, send the packet straight to the host (router can be in multiple subnets, one on each interface)
    2. If host is in a different subnet, send the packet to the next hop router (known through routing table)

        - Use the data-link FCS to check for transmission error, discard the frame if there were errors
        - discard the old data-link header and trailer
        - Compare the destination IP address to the routing table. The route that matches the destination identifies the outgoing interface
        - Build a new datalink header and trailer for the packet

IP ROUTING PROTOCOLS
    IP routing depends on having an accurate and up to date routing table

    ROLES OF A ROUTING PROTOCOL
        1. Dynamically learn and fill the routing table with routes to all subnetworks
        2. Choose the best route to a subnet if more than one route exists
        3. Remove invalid routes from the routing table
        4. Add new routes or replace lost routes as quickly as possible (convergence time)
        5. Prevent routing loops (packet endlessly routed in a loop)

    FUNCTIONS OF A ROUTING Protocol
        1. Adds route to it's routing table for all directly connected subnets (The subnets it's interfaces are in)
        2. Advertise to neighboring routers all routes in the current routing table (routing update)
        3. Add routes advertised by neighboring routers to routing table with the neighboring router as the next hop router

NETWORK UTILITIES

    DNS (Domain Name Resolution):           Resolves a host name to an IP address. Runs on a server. Each host knows the IP address of it's local DNS server
    ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):      Finds a MAC address of a host in the same subnet given the hosts IP address. (sends out a broadcast message on the subnet)
    DHCP (Dynamic Host Protocol):           Automatically assigns IP addresses, default gateway, DNS server and network masks to hosts on a subnet (normally can't go through a router)
    ping (ICMP echo request):               Sends a packets to another host requesting it to return a packet (used to test connectivity over a network)

    NOTE: Results of a ARP broadcast are stored in the hosts ARP cache
    NOTE: servers generally have a static IP addresses so clients know where to find them, as such they do not use DHCP
