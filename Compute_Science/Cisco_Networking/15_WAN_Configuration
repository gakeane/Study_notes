NOTES
    Cisco routers default to using Ethernet as the layer 2 protocol

CONFIGURING HDLC

    IOS defaults to use HDLC as the encapsulation protocol on serial links

          MANDATORY
      1. "ip address <address> <mask>" on interface

          CONDITIONAL
      2. "no shutdown" on interface                           Only if the interface is administratively down
      3. "encapsulation hdlc"                                 Only if another encapsulation protocol is in use
      4. "clock rate <speed in bps>"                          Only if the routers are back to back and only on the DCE router (otherwise clock is done by CSU/DSU)
            - "show controllers serial 0/1"       Shows if a serial interface is acting as a DCE or DTE
            - "show interfaces serial 0/1"        Shows what encapsulation protocol the interface is running

          OPTIONAL
      5. "bandwidth <speed in kbps>"
      6. "description <message>"

CONFIGURING PPP
    This is the same as configuring HDLC but we must declare that we are using PPP on BOTH routers
        "encapsulation ppp" on interface


SECURITY DEVICE MANAGER (SDM)
    Web service run on the router allowing configuration through a web browser (Router must have an IP address for the web server)
    Does not use SSH or Telnet
    There is an alternative called Cisco device manager (CDM)

        - When you select finish on a wizard all the commands are run on the router
        - This is saved the the running-config but not the startup-config
        - We can do a "copy running-config startup-config" by clicking the save button at the top tab


ACCESS ROUTER CONFIGURATION STEPS

    1. Configure the local LAN router interface with an IP address
          - Generally we use the 192.168.4.0/24 private network

    2. Install SDM on the router
          - There are some additional steps not covered in the exam for enabling SDM

    3. Connect to SDM on the router using a PC on the local LAN
          - There are some additional steps not covered in the exam for enabling SDM

    4. Configure PAT on the router using SDM
          - see next step

    5. Configure DHCP client on the internet facing interface
          5a. configure -> interfaces and connections -> Create new connection                                  Will now configure one of the interfaces
                  - By default an interface with no IP address configured is selected to be a DHCP client
          5b. check Dynamic (DHCP client) radial button
          5c. check enable PAT radial button
                  - Ensure that the interface to be translated is the local LAN interface

    6. Configure DHCP server on the LAN facing interface
          6a. Choose a subnet for the private IP network (i.e. 192.168.4.0/24)
          6b. Choose a range of IP address that can be assigned by DHCP
                - This must be in the range of the private network
                - We should not allow the IP address of the router (local interface) to be assigned by the DHCP server
                - i.e 192.168.4.101  ->  192.168.4.254
                - i.e 192.168.4.1   ->   192.168.4.100 will be left for static address
          6c. The router's local interface will be the default gateway assigned by the DHCP server
          6d. Use the "show dhcp server" command to get the IP address of the DNS server assigned by the ISP
                - This will be the same DNS server assigned to all hosts on the private network
                - This will also show the DNS domain name

          6e. Configure using SDM
                - Configure -> additional tasks -> DHCP pools -> add
                - Enter:
                      - network + subnet mask
                      - Starting and ending IP address range (for assignment)
                      - DNS server IP address
                      - Domain name
                      - Default gateway


TROUBLESHOOTING COMMANDS
    1. "show ip dhcp binding"                       Shows the IP address and MAC address of hosts which where assigned an IP address through DHCP
    2. "show ip nat translations"                   shows the current NAT translation table
    3. "clear ip nat translations *"                clears the NAT translation table


DHCP CLI CONFIGURATION
    Start in global config mode

    "ip dhcp exclude-address 192.168.4.1 192.168.4.10"
    "ip dhcp pool Pool_Name"
    "network 192.168.4.0 255.255.255.0"
    "default router 192.168.4.1"
    "dns-server 8.8.8.8"

    use "show ip dhcp binding" to check what addresses DHCP has been assigned to is working
    To configure an interface using dhcp us "ip address dhcp"
