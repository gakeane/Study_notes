COMMANDS

    local login:                                Tells ISO to compare login details against globally configured username/password rather than that on the line vty/console
    username <name> password <passwd>:          Set a global username and password pair. Can be used multiple times from global configuration mode
    crypto key generate rsa                     Create cryptographic keys for SSH
    transport input {telnet | ssh | all none}   enable/disable protocols on line console and line vty

    switch-port nonnegotiate                    Turn off Dynamic Trunking protocol (DTP), must be off to enable switch-port security

SECURING THE SWITCH CLI
    To access enabled mode through Telnet or SSH the switch must have
        1. An IP address
        2. "login" and "password" configured on the vty lines
        3. An enable password (use "enable secret" or "enable password")

    SSH access requires that the user supply both a username and password
    These can be configured on the switch or on an AAA server which is then accessed by the switch

    - "line vty 0 15"                                   Go to vty configuration mode
    - "login local"                                     Set local login (replaces "login" command)
    - "transport input <all | telnet | ssh>"            Allow the transport and SSH protocols over the vty (only telnet is used by default)
    - "exit"                                            Return to global configuration mode

    - "username <user> password <passwd>"               Create a user and password for that user on the switch
    - "hostname <hostname>"                             Required to generate RSA key
    - "ip domain-name <domain.com>"                      Set a DNS domain name for the switch (Required to generate RSA key)
    - "crypto key generate rsa"                         Create cryptographic keys for SSH encryption

    We can view the keys we generate with "show crypto key mypubkey rsa"
    We can disable telnet access using the "transport input ssh" or "transport input none" commands
    Use the "service password-encryption" command to encrypt the passwords in the running-config and startup-config files
        Note: if the "no service password-encryption" command is used the passwords remain encrypted until they are changed

    If both the "enable secret" and "enable password" commands are used the "enable secret" command overrides the "enable password" command


BANNERS
    Banners us e a delimiting character around the message (this character can be anything)
    There are three types of banner message

        1. MOTD (message of the day):           Shown before the login prompt
        2. Login:                               Shown before the login prompt but after the message of the day
        3. Exec:                                Shown after the login prompt

HISTORY BUFFERS
    "show history"                              Show all the commands held in history buffer
    "history size <size>"                       Sets the size of the history buffer for console and ty lines (use from vty and console config mode)
    "terminal history size <size>"              Set size of history buffer for single connection (resets after user logs out)

    "logging synchronous"                       console and vty config mode, prevents the switch from displaying syslog messages in the middle of commands
    "exec-timeout <mins> <secs>"                console and vty inactive timeout setting (from console and vty config mode), setting to 0 disables timeout


CONFIGURE SWITCH IP ADDRESS

    The switch's IP is set for VLAN 1. It can then be accessed by any machine connected to an interface on VLAN 1

        1. "interface vlan 1"                                 Configure VLAN 1 (VLAN 1 will be included in a trunk link)
        2. "ip address <IP address> <mask>"                   Create an ip address and mask on VLAN 1
        3. "no shutdown"                                      Enable VLAN 1 (down by default)
        4. ip default-gateway (global config command)         Set the gateway for the switch (global configuration command)

    We can also assign a switch IP and gateway using DHCP

        1. replace "ip address <ip address> <mask>"" with "ip address dhcp"
        2. Don't use the "ip default-gateway" command as this will override DHCP

    This will assign an IP address to the configured VLAN
    Use "show dhcp lease" to view the IP address since it won't be in the running-config output


CONFIGURE ETHERNET INTERFACE

    - "interface <interface type> <interface number"              enter interface configuration mode
    - "speed <10|100|1000|auto>"                                  set the speed of the interface
    - "duplex <half|full|auto>"                                   set the duplex mode of the interface
    - "description <message>"                                     set a description on the interface
    - "no shutdown"                                               enable the interface

    - "show interfaces"                                           privileged mode command. shows status about all interfaces
    " interface range FastEthernet 0/11 - 20"                     used to apply the same configuration to all interfaces 11 - 20


PORT SECURITY
    Restricts what machines can access a single port
    Port security is configured for a single interface in interface configuration mode
        1. Make the port an access port (switch knows it will not be used for trunking)
        2. Enable port security on the interface
        3. Define what machines have access to the port

    - "interface FastEthernet 0/1"                                              Enter interface configuration mode
    - "switchport mode access"                                                  Make the interface an access port

    - "switchport port-security"                                                Enable port security on the interface

    - "switchport port-security maximum <number>"                               Set the maximum number of machines that can connect to the port (optional, 1 by default)
    - "switchport port-security violation {protect | restrict | shutdown}"      Set what the port will do if the security is violated (optional, shutdown by default)
    - "switchport port-security mac-address {mac-address | sticky}"             set the mac address that are allowed access to the port (can be used multiple times)

    - "show port-security interface fastethernet 0/1"                           shows the port security configured on interface FastEthernet 0/1

    If sticky is chosen then the interface will use the first N mac addresses it receives packets from where N is the maximum number of allowed addresses
    When an interface is shutdown due to a security violation it is placed in the err-disable state. To bring the interface back up it needs to be shutdown
    with the "shutdown" command and then brought back up with the "no shutdown" command

        Protect:          Discards offending traffic
        Restrict:         Sends log message and discards offending traffic
        Shutdown:         Disables the interface, sends a log message and discards the offending traffic


VLAN CONFIGURATION

    By default all interfaces belong to VLAN 1

    CREATE NEW VLAN
        1. Use the "vlan <vlan_id>" global configuration command
        2. Use the "name <vlan_name>" VLAN sub-command to name the VLAN (optional)
              - If we forget we can re-enter the vlan config mode by re-issuing the command "vlan <vlan_id>"

    ATTACH AN INTERFACE TO A VLAN
        1. "interface FastEthernet 0/5"                       Go to interface configuration mode
        2. "switchport access vlan <vlan_id>"                 Assign the interface to a VLAN (Doing this with a non-existant VLAn will cause the VLAN to be created )
        3. "switchport mode access"                           If not already done disable trunking on the interface (make interface an access port)

    Use the "show vlan brief" command in privileged mode to view VLAN information


SECURING UNUSED INTERFACES

    1. "shutdown"                                   Administratively shutdown the interface
    2. "switchport mode access"                     Disable trunking on the interface
    3. "switchport access vlan <vlan_id>"           Assign the interface to an unused VLAN


STATICALLY CONFIGURE MAC ADDRESS

    In global configuration mode
        "mac-address-table static <mac_address>"
