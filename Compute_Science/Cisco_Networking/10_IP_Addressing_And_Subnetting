NOTES
  All masks must consist of an unbroken string of 1s followed by an unbroken string of zeros
  XX are used in the subnet mask to denote bits which can be either a 1 or a 0 and still meet design requirements (i.e. 11111111 1111XXXX 00000000 00000000)

CLASS-FULL NETWORKS

  CLASS A: 1.0.0.0 -> 126.0.0.0            1 byte in network part of address (2^7 - 2 networks and 2^24 - 2 hosts)
  CLASS B: 128.0.0.0 -> 191.255.0.0        2 bytes in network part of address (2^14 - 2 networks and 2^16 - 2 hosts)
  CLASS C: 192.0.0.0 -> 223.255.255.0      3 bytes in network part of address (2^21 - 2 networks and 2^8 - 2 hosts)

  network 0.0.0.0 and network 127.0.0.0 are used are reserved as the broadcast and loop-back networks
  By definition an IP address beginning with 8 is a class A network, an IP address beginning with 130 is a class B network and an IP address beginning with 202 is a class C network


PRIVATE IP NETWORKS

  10.0.0.0                          -> class A private network (1 network)
  172.16.0.0 -> 172.31.0.0          -> class B private network (16 networks)
  192.168.0.0 -> 192.168.255.0      -> class C private network (256 networks)

  These networks are never assigned to a company on the public internet
  This private addressing is useful for use with NAT (network address translation), allows the private network to also connect to the internet


  prefix notation/CIDR notation is method of decalring subnets with a / i.e. 192.168.4.0/24

NUMBER OF HOSTS AND SUBNETS

  number of subnets = 2^s where s = (32 - N - h) and N is the number of bits in the network mask (i.e. 8 for class A network)
  number of hosts = 2^h - 2 where h is the number of 0 bits in the subnet mask

  In some cases we can't assign the broadcast (all host bits set to 1) and network (all hosts bits set to 0) addresses as subnets
  When using classless routing protocols (RIPv2) or VLSM we can use these two subnets, when using class-full routing protocols (RIPv1) we can not (i.e. number of subnets = 2^s - 2)
  If the ip subnet zero global command is configured on a cisco router (is by default) then we can use the two special subnets

QUICK WAY OF CALCULATING SUBNET NUMBERS

  1. for the interesting octet subtract the value of the subnet mask in the interesting octet from 256
  2. Find the multiple of this value which is closest to, but not greater than the value of the network in the interesting octet
  Example: given network 130.4.102.1 and netmask 255.255.252.0 find the subnet address
      - the interesting octet is the third octet where the value of the sub net is neither 255 or 0
      - 256 - 252 = 4
      - 4 x 25 = 100 is the closest we can get to 102 without exceeding it so we replace the third octet in the network address with 100
      - ans: 130.4.100.0 is the network number
      - we can then find the broadcast address for the interesting octet by adding (256 - 252) - 1 to the value of the subnet number in the interesting octet
      - ans 100 + (256 - 252) - 4 = 103 -> 130.4.103.255 is the broadcast address

CALCULATE ALL ALLOWABLE SUBNETS GIVEN A MASK
  1. calculate the magic number by subtracting the subnet mask from 256 for the interesting octet
  2. Then given the class network number (i.e. 130.4.0.0 for a class B network) the subnets are all multiples of the magic number in the interesting octet up to the subnet mask
  Example: Class B network 130.4.0.0 and mask 255.255.252.0. Find all possible subnets
      - magic number -> 256 - 252 = 4
      - subnets = 130.4.0.0, 130.4.4.0, 130.4.8.0, 130.4.12.0, 130.4.16.0, 130.4.20.0, 130.4.24.0, ... , 130.4.248.0, 130.4.252.0
