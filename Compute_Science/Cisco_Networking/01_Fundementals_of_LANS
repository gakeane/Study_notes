ETHERNET STANDARDS
    Set of standards that define the physical and datalink layers
    To use the Ethernet standard each host will require an Ethernet Network Interface Card (NIC)

    802.3 Media Access Control (MAC) Sublayer (Physical Layer + MAC)
    802.2 Logical Link Control (LLC) Sublayer (Remainder of the Datalink Layer)

    Ethernet              (10BASE-T)      10 Mbps       100m (UTP)      802.3
    FastEthernet          (100BASE-TX)    100 Mbps      100m (UTP)      802.3u
    Gigabit Ethernet      (1000BASE-T)    1000 Mbps     100m (UTP)      802.3ab
    Gigabit Ethernet      (1000BASE-LX)   1000 Mbps     5000m (Fiber)   802.3z

    10BASE-2
        Co-axial cables connected all devices to a single central Bus (no Hub or switch)
        When a computer sends some bits to another computer all computers on the BUS receive those bits
        If Two computers try to send data at the same time there will be a collision and the data will be lost
        Uses the CSMA/CD algorithm to deal with collisions

        All devices on the network share the bandwidth of the Bus
        Cable length of up to 185m
        Speed of 10 Mbps

    10BASE-5
        Same as 10BASE02 but allows cable lengths of up to 500m

    CSMA/CD
        Carrier sense - Hosts wait until the Bus is clear before sending
        Multiple Access - Algorithm allows multiple hosts to share the bandwidth of the Bus
        Collision detection - Collisions are detected by listening for a voltage spike on the line

        In the event of a collision both sending computers wait a random amount (back-off) of time and then try to resend their data if the line is free
        Must be implemented on all devices communicating on the network


REPEATERS (Layer 1 Device)
    Attenuation - loss of power of a signal as it travels over a medium
    A repeater solves the issue of attenuation for signals sent over long distances by repeating an incoming signal exactly as it came in
    Note that this is not the same as amplification, since this would also amplify the noise
    Hubs, switches and Routers all act as repeaters


HUBS (Layer 1 Device)
    The introduction of the 10BASE-T standard saw all hosts cabled to a single centralized hub or switch (switches much more common)
    This meant a breakage in the line would only result in the loss of access to a single host

    Hubs simply receive an input signal and repeat it out all of its ports
     - All devices connected to a HUB are in the same collision domain
     - All devices connected to a HUB share the bandwidth
     - All devices connected to a HUB must use CSMA/CD


UTP Cabling
    UTP cabling uses either 2 or 4 pairs of copper wires in a plastic jacket
    Each wire has a different color making it easy to identify
    RJ-45 (as 8 pin positions) connectors are used at each end of the wire
    TIA and EIA define the standards for UTP cabling

    TRANSMITTING DATA
        When send information over a wire the current creates a magnetic field which would disrupt signals on other nearby wire
        To prevent this UTP transmits data on two wires by passing a current through the wires in opposite directions
        Since the wires are twisted together the opposing magnetic fields cancel each other out

        A 0 is encoded as a transition from high to low voltage in the middle of a 10^-6 second interval (for 10BASE-t)
        A 1 is encoded as a transition from low to high voltage in the middle of a 10^-6 second interval (for 10BASE-t)

        Data is send over one pair of twisted wires and received over the other (at least two pairs required for FUL Duplex communication)
        1000BASE-T uses 4 twisted pairs for communication (details below)

    UTP PINOUTS
        Hosts and Routers and wireless access points send on pins 1 and 2 and receive on pins 3 and 6
        Switches and Hubs send on pins 3 and 6 and receive on pins 1 and 2

        When connecting a PC to a Switch or HUB we use a straight through cable
        When connecting a PC to a router or a switch to another switch (trunk) we use a cross over cable

        In a cross-over cable pin 1 connects to ping 3 and pin 2 connects to pin 6

    1000BASE-T CABLING
        Uses 4 pair instead of 2
        Can transmit and receive on all pair simultaneously
        The cross-over cable also connects ping 4 to pin 7 and pin 5 to pin 8
