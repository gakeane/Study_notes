OSI MODEL
    Formal attempt at an open source network model standard

    Application         (Layer 7)         User authentication and communication with software outside the network stack
    Presentation        (Layer 6)         Encryption, Compression and data formats such as ASCII and JPEG
    Session             (Layer 5)         Controls the flow of data between two communicating machines (dialogue control) -> (SQL, NFS, SMB)
    Transport           (Layer 4)         Data delivery, flow control and error recovery
    Network             (Layer 3)         logical addressing, routing, sub-netting and path determination
    Data Link           (Layer 2)         Hard ware addressing. Sending frame over a sub-network, ARP, Frame Check sequence (FCS)
    Physical            (Layer 1)         hardware, pin and cabling standards. converting data into a string of bits for sending

    The lower four layers focus on end-to-end delivery of data across a network

TCP/IP MODEL
    Informal public network model standardization created by the US defense department

    Application         (Layer 4)                     HTTP, POP3, SMTP, TFTP, WWW
    Transport           (Layer 3)       (segment)     TCP, UDP
    Internet            (Layer 2)       (packet)      IP
    Network Access      (Layer 1)       (frame)       Ethernet, Frame Relay, 802q, HDLC

    Note: The Network access layer is often split into two layers, the Data Link Layer and the Physical layer to match the lowest two layers of the OSI model

DEFINITIONS
    Same layer interaction - communication between two separate machines at the same layer (i.e. HTTP packets between client and server)
    Adjacent layer interaction - A lower layer in the network stack (on the same machine) provides a service for the layer above it (TCP provides reliable transport for HTTP)
    Data Encapsulation - Each layer adds it's own header to the data as the data is passed down the network stack

    PDU (Protocol Data Unit) - OSI equivilent of frame (Layer2 PDU), packet (Layer3 PDU) and segment (Layer4 PDU)

APPLICATION LAYER
    Provides a connection between services running on the OS and the network stack

    Example: A web browser is a piece of software. A user requests a web page through the browser by providing the address of that web page
    The browser uses the HTTP protocol (Layer 7) to transfer the content of the web page from the server where it is stored to the machine running the browser
    The HTTP protocol in turn uses TCP to establish a connection to the Web server and TCP in turn uses IP and the web servers address to locate the web server on the internet


TRANSPORT LAYER
    Provides a service for the application Layer. that service is the reliable transmission of data across a Network
    TCP includes an error recovery feature using acknowledgements. (i.e. if a packet is lost or corrupted in transit, then it is resent)
    TCP also reorders packets that arrive out of turn
    UDP does neither of these things

    The main aspects of this layer are data recovery and reliable transport
    Transport layer protocols work the same regardless of the underlying network. It is the role of the internet and Network Access Layers to understand the network topology

INTERNET (IP) LAYER
    Provides a unique address for every host on a network and is responsible for delivering a packet of information from one machine to another
    Packets are sent across a network using routers which makes a decision on where to send the packet next based on a destination IP address

    The main aspects of this layer are address and routing
    The IP layer is not concern with the underlying technology that makes the network for each hop (i.e. Ethernet, Leased Line)

NETWORK ACCESS LAYER
    Responsible for sending a packet across a physical medium (such as Ethernet or a leased line)
    Defines the hardware standards for each cabling type (RJ-45)
    Defines hardware addressing for sending frames between hosts on the same sub-network
    Also includes the physical layer which encodes the data into a string of bits to be transmitted across a medium (physical or wireless)

    Includes all the variations of Ethernet protocols for LANs
    Includes all the WAN standards such as PPP, HDLC and Frame Relay

    Most Network Access Layer protocols also add a trailer to the data as well as a header
    These Trailer and headers are removed at each hop on the route

    LLC/802.2 (Logical Link Control):         Responsible for identifying the layer 3 protocol contained in the frame
    802.3


ADVANTAGES OF A NETWORK MODEL

    - Less Complex
    - Standard Interface
    - Easier to Learn
    - Easier to Develop
    - Multivendor interoperability
    - Modular Engineering


HTTP PROTOCOL
    Client sends a HTTP Header to the server. the header includes a GET request for a page (file) on the server
    Servers responds the content of the file in the payload of the HTTP packets and a response code in the HTTP header

    404: File not found on server
    200: Request successful
